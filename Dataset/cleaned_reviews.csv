My account says its been temporarily locked. I didnt do anything to violate the rules against the app and when Ive tried making a new account to use that one to contact my friends and family that account gets deleted as well. The app was working so well but it seems like theres an update that was done thats giving everyone this issue. Ive tried contacting Snapchats support team as well and it was no use only to receive a page being told how this could of happened. Its been 24 hours now and there is still no change at all. All of my memories are on that app from 2014 and now its all gone like that without even a notice. Snapchat please make a solution to this issue its ridiculous that we have to worry about not being able to access our personal information from this app. And please make a customer service phone number because trying to contact you guys is so darn difficult its not easy and it shouldnt have to be that way. Im sure many people can agree with me we need the app to be fixed as soon as possible !,3,account say temporarili lock didnt anyth violat rule app ive tri make new account use one contact friend famili account get delet well app work well seem like there updat done that give everyon issu ive tri contact snapchat support team well use receiv page told could happen 24 hour still chang memori app 2014 gone like without even notic snapchat plea make solut issu ridicul worri abl access person inform app plea make custom servic phone number tri contact guy darn difficult easi shouldnt way im sure mani peopl agre need app fix soon possibl

Facebook invades users privacy by using certain types of technology (Apples Siri for example) to listen into personal private conversations evidenced by extremely direct targeted ads that appear on users feed within hours of private conversation.

"This communist run company steals our data then sells it. They arbitrarily remove peoples content, property, creations, memories, etc. all if they disagree with person who has the account. They hate and censor conservatives. They push fake vaccines that dont work and censor any information that dares to criticize them of anything on the left. Meanwhile they are fine with Holocaust Denial content. Where are the disclaimers for that? And content that incites is Islamic terror and the murder of Jews. That is OK with Facebook! But God forbid we question the vaccines that dont even work and may even be dangerous. It is an extreme leftist company/cult. Its employees are cult members. Zuck is an entitled weirdo. So was his sister. One of these days Im going to drive up to Dobbs Fairy and tell Marks parents what a horrible kid they brought into the world. He/his company has arbitrarily destroyed about 50% of my activist work I was doing on the platform. Theyve destroyed many of accounts and groups. Without valid reason. Theyve been doing it to me since I joined the platform. The company is intolerant of facts, history, logic, ethics, or morals. On top of all that they steal your data and sell it to others for profit. Lastly I experimented with their advertising where you pay to either help build a page or promote posts. I experimented with this once to get new follows. I directed my ad toward only people who work in a certain industry in NYC. I only got a few new follows. From fake accounts outside of the USA. I of course couldnt get a hold of anyone to get a refund. Facebook offers no valid customary support. Because they dont view as humans or customers. We are product/data to them. They are a highly inhumane and unethical company. God willing they will be destroyed soon once everyone wakes up. And Zuck belongs in prison. The company should be fined and regulated out of business. Theyve arbitrarily destroyed so much of my personal property/ideas/memories that I shared on the platform all because they didnt agree with it. Because the company is extreme left wing and I happen to be on the right. Now they do this in bulk. Millions of conservatives/republicans are censored. Accounts and pages destroyed or dont reach enough people as Facebook has algorithms to silence conservatives/republicans. I work hard to use Facebook and their other products very little. And I try to delete them off my phone. But they make their apps purposely to be addictive. Which is also evil. They dont care one iota about anyone who uses the platform, especially if you are on the right politically. Zuck runs his company like a totalitarian dictatorship and basic free speech that the regime doesnt like is censored or doesnt react many people. Once they label you as an effective conservative activist both you and your pages are at risk. Best for right wingers to fully get away from leftist big tech. They hate us. They censor us. They destroy our work. And our accounts. Never for valid reasons. Its just because they dont like our views. In short they are actually a fascist company. And shouldnt even exist anymore in the USA as they dont meet the standards or LAWS of this country. They put up misinformation disclaimers to support all the leftist narratives. But they dont even take down Holocaust Denial content or put any disclaimers on it. As Im addicted to FB and IG since they literally built them to be addictive, its difficult for me to not be active on the platforms. But Im trying. I suggest anyone who values free speech but who is against real hate speech, and incitement of violence, to do the same. Especially if you are on the right. There will become a loony most leftists will realize these things too, as Facebook again is an extremist left wing company in and of itself. So moderate or centrist leftists will eventfully be censored/silenced too. Facecooks agenda is to steal and sell your data, profiting off of you. But if they dont like your views (which do not break Facebooks terms) and youre an effective online activist, they will do the things I mentioned above. Everyone who has ever had their accounts or pages wrongly destroyed by Facebook should create/join a global class action suit against the company. Also what sort of company has zero real customer service? There are no real humans that work at Facebook. Just brainwashed cult followers. No real humanity there. They dont care about the people they mess with and hurt, especially if they disagree with you. The company is not fair or even handed. They are pure evil and they company should be destroyed. Zuck who is a fascist tyrant should be fined out of existence. And then imprisoned for life. Everything Ive said applies to the majority of not all the leftist Big Tech companies, even Apple. They dont treat their customers right. And if they dislike your views you are not a human being to them. Youre just someone they will arbitrarily mess with and censor.",2,communist run compani steal data sell arbitrarili remov peopl content properti creation memori etc disagre person account hate censor conserv push fake vaccin dont work censor inform dare critic anyth left meanwhil fine holocaust denial content disclaim content incit islam terror murder jew ok facebook god forbid question vaccin dont even work may even danger extrem leftist companycult employe cult member zuck entitl weirdo sister one day im go drive dobb fairi tell mark parent horribl kid brought world hehi compani arbitrarili destroy 50 activist work platform theyv destroy mani account group without valid reason theyv sinc join platform compani intoler fact histori logic ethic moral top steal data sell other profit lastli experi advertis pay either help build page promot post experi get new follow direct ad toward peopl work certain industri nyc got new follow fake account outsid usa cours couldnt get hold anyon get refund facebook offer valid customari support dont view human custom productdata highli inhuman uneth compani god will destroy soon everyon wake zuck belong prison compani fine regul busi theyv arbitrarili destroy much person propertyideasmemori share platform didnt agre compani extrem left wing happen right bulk million conservativesrepublican censor account page destroy dont reach enough peopl facebook algorithm silenc conservativesrepublican work hard use facebook product littl tri delet phone make app purpos addict also evil dont care one iota anyon use platform especi right polit zuck run compani like totalitarian dictatorship basic free speech regim doesnt like censor doesnt react mani peopl label effect conserv activist page risk best right winger fulli get away leftist big tech hate u censor u destroy work account never valid reason dont like view short actual fascist compani shouldnt even exist anymor usa dont meet standard law countri put misinform disclaim support leftist narr dont even take holocaust denial content put disclaim im addict fb ig sinc liter built addict difficult activ platform im tri suggest anyon valu free speech real hate speech incit violenc especi right becom looni leftist realiz thing facebook extremist left wing compani moder centrist leftist event censoredsilenc facecook agenda steal sell data profit dont like view break facebook term your effect onlin activist thing mention everyon ever account page wrongli destroy facebook createjoin global class action suit compani also sort compani zero real custom servic real human work facebook brainwash cult follow real human dont care peopl mess hurt especi disagre compani fair even hand pure evil compani destroy zuck fascist tyrant fine exist imprison life everyth ive said appli major leftist big tech compani even appl dont treat custom right dislik view human your someon arbitrarili mess censor

Facebook turns people into products. They manipulate algorithms to spoon feed certain ideologies and to suppress others. All while making BILLIONS as they collect and sell every bit of personal information you provide. Youre literally just a human battery in the Matrix when you use Facebook. And free speech on the platform is highly suppressed. Theyre too busy catering to their woke agenda. Dont expect their alleged community standards team to be anything close to reasonable if youre not a full blown anarchy loving communist who hates America. It should be renamed community DOUBLE standards team.

"My account was hacked in April. They changed my name and profile picture to a Vietnamese celebrity. The email addresses they changed for notification and security to are Russian. I finally got back after days of sending my identity and resetting passwords but now the account is disabled for Community Guidelines verification. Facebook says I have one day before they permanently delete my account. I am the CEO of a non-profit and the administrator for my organization and another page. My URL is gone. You cant search me by email, phone, name, or URL. Its all gone. My career highlights, the ceremony when my brother died, my children growing, messages from people that I only communicate with on FB or that passed away. I never knew this could happen. That you would lose all of your Facebook photos, messages, posts, with no warning and no response after myself and others have emailed, reported, screenshot, everything we can do. Countless requests for help and reports and not one response. However, I did get an email stating that Meta Business approved three ads, in what looks to be an Asian language, and they are running. I dont know where theyre running. I cant get to my profile, or any of the pages to remove our payment information. Its been well over a month of the most infuriating, endless loop, of getting no where. I only want my photos, messages, and payment information off of there. I need a profile for the thousands of followers for the agency but I cannot believe they have no Customer Support. Theres no number to call. Theres no way to report without access to the profile. All I can do is log-out and change the language. Theres no Help option. I have to email and no response. I have to have friends, staff, and family report, and no response. I feel like Im in the Twilight Zone. I have had different accounts hacked before but I have never had so much trouble trying to recover what was taken. The things are on FB are more valuable than money. Theyre irreplaceable and theyre going to delete it without ever speaking to me about. Back up your profiles!!! Turn on the trustee friend option, or dont use this app. Since this has happened I have been told by a dozen of my friends that they never recovered their pages and read a hundred horror stories that match mine.

"I keep having issues where the same 5 people I always tag in stuff (on public pages), their name will just completely stop popping up when I go to tag them. Every other random person on my timeline will pop up to tag, but not my close friends. I keep reporting the issue and it will get fixed for a little bit but then it will happen again. 

Also the ads are out of control, scammers on every major page trying to get people to message them and click on links or send them money, TONS of fake pages selling fake products that you will never receive or it will be completely wrong. Most of those pages are Chinese. I keep reporting them but they are never ending.

I hate getting notifications for random friends going live. I didnt ask to be notified about it so idk why I keep getting them. 

Everytime Im on the Facebook market, I change the filter to show ONLY local items but I STILL see advertisements for online purchases, and people selling stuff across the country. Trying to find something local is much harder due to all of the irrelevant stuff Facebook allows to be posted in the market, even with the location filters being applied. I tried to sell some purses and Facebook didnt allow my post because they said I could be selling fake name-brand items. Which they werent fake so how are you going to delete my post just because they might be fake without any proof to back it up. Facebook has no problem allowing fake pages to sell fake items all over the place but draw the line at someone trying to get purge some purses from their closet?

Your policies say you dont allow nudity or stuff that is sexual in nature but when I report it, you say it doesnt go against community standards. Why have it as an option to click on when someone reports something then? Facebook has no problem showing nude images of Melania Trump but lets see how fast they take down nude images of someone else. They also have no issue allowing nude and sexual images posted on peoples pages promoting their onlyfans. If I wanted to see onlyfans-type content, I would get an onlyfans. 

 Also, I think its funny that Facebook fact-checks anything that is speaking against liberals/democrats etc, but Ive NEVER seen a fact check for any false information spread about conservatives. Its so blatantly biased at this point. You could even post a direct quote or video and theyll fact check it saying its out of context, but yet dont point out the lacking context for anything speaking against conservatives. I dont appreciate the obvious political bias on social media and the constant censorship. You cant post ANYTHING now without being censored. Even if its very mild in nature. They suppress any page that they dont want people to see if they dont agree with it. So even if they dont take your post down or fact-check it, they will make it so that not as many people will have it appear on their timeline. Its disgusting how much they control what information is reaching people and the obvious agenda they are pushing.  JUST STOP. I dont care what party anyone supports, just show it all fairly across the board and let the people decide for themselves. 

I keep hitting the hide option for COVID information posts from Facebook and yet I keep seeing them and have it shoved down my throat. 

Also, I changed my settings so that Facebook couldnt collect data from past searches to help them target their ads, but yet I could talk about something at my house or buy something at Walmart and next thing I know, Facebook is bombarding me with ads on the SAME EXACT item that I was just talking about. 

I keep Facebook to keep up with friends and family far away and so that they can keep up with me, if that wasnt the case, I wouldve deleted it long ago.

"Facebook Marketplace used to be so easy to use.  You could search by category, and at the top of the screen, there would be icons for sub-categories, then you could choose filters within that search.   (For example: Furniture &gt; Office Furniture &gt; Desks &gt; Style &gt; Local listings only)
But, now the sub-categories seem to have disappeared and all you can do is choose the category and a few top-level filters.  (Furniture &gt; Local listings only)
Whats odd to me is that once in a great while, I still see sub-category icons at the top of the screen, but thats about 0.1% of the time.  And, every time you select a filter or change the search, it removes the local-only filter and you have to go back and re-select it.
Also, while scrolling, its WAY too easy to accidentally swipe a little teeny tiny bit too much to the right, which takes you back to the previous page, and you lose your place and have to start all the way back at the top of the way-too-long list of items (that wouldve been much shorter had the sub-categories still been available).
And the search?  Forget about it.  I can search a keyword (e.g. mirror) with the local filter on and about half the time Ill get like 8 listings, then about 10,000 listings show up below under Results Outside Your Search even though a good portion of those items should have been within my search (e.g. a bunch of mirrors that are definitely local to me mixed in with non-local items).  
AND half the time it includes a bunch of stuff WITH my search results that are NOT related (I just search credenza and got a whole bunch of listings for dressers that dont even mention the word credenza).
I thought maybe it was a fluke/clash with iOS version/etc, so I updated the app and even tried uninstalling/reinstalling FB but no, still woefully effed up.

ALSO, the functionality for those wishing to offer shipping is a joke, which has led a lot of people to either make mistakes about whether theyre able to ship items (huge items that as someone who owns a business selling online, I know this very well would cost more to ship than the price theyre asking for the item itself) or use workarounds that lead to their items showing up in my feed even though theres no way they could ever send those items to me (especially via USPS).
Its pretty frustrating that FB doesnt even say anything about box sizes (or types... like using a Priority Mail box) and youre left guessing as to what to do if your package is a couple ounces over.
Rather than going into too many details on what FB needs to offer to its sellers (shipping), I suggest the developers do a bit more digging into the functionality of other online selling platforms, or partner with a company that handles these logistics all the time.  I get wanting to keep it simple, but at least offering the option of using more precise tools would be a game-changer.",3,facebook marketplac use easi use could search categori top screen would icon subcategori could choos filter within search exampl furnitur gt offic furnitur gt desk gt style gt local list subcategori seem disappear choos categori toplevel filter furnitur gt local list what odd great still see subcategori icon top screen that 01 time everi time select filter chang search remov localonli filter go back reselect also scroll way easi accident swipe littl teeni tini bit much right take back previou page lose place start way back top waytoolong list item wouldv much shorter subcategori still avail search forget search keyword eg mirror local filter half time ill get like 8 list 10000 list show result outsid search even though good portion item within search eg bunch mirror definit local mix nonloc item half time includ bunch stuff search result relat search credenza got whole bunch list dresser dont even mention word credenza thought mayb flukeclash io versionetc updat app even tri uninstallingreinstal fb still woefulli ef also function wish offer ship joke led lot peopl either make mistak whether theyr abl ship item huge item someon own busi sell onlin know well would cost ship price theyr ask item use workaround lead item show feed even though there way could ever send item especi via usp pretti frustrat fb doesnt even say anyth box size type like use prioriti mail box your left guess packag coupl ounc rather go mani detail fb need offer seller ship suggest develop bit dig function onlin sell platform partner compani handl logist time get want keep simpl least offer option use precis tool would gamechang

Additional to the ridiculousness of their censorship it does little to promote positive engagement without just banning everyone. Another issue for some time now is the growing amount of ads and the amount of personal data collected from users and sold to third parties. Its had a good run but I think its time for a new platform.,2,new censorship ai review process extrem inconsist frustrat whether report someon harass whether someth post flag seem consist accept real recours deeper accur review addit ridicul censorship littl promot posit engag without ban everyon anoth issu time grow amount ad amount person data collect user sold third parti good run think time new platform

"Do not use Facebook. The stories, posts, etc. which you encounter while browsing Facebook make an impact on your life. Some of these impacts are small, minor, perhaps inconsequential. Others are major, often deeply upsetting, potentially even traumatizing. All of these impacts are presented to you by algorithms beyond your control.

"I was trying to but a power tool. Presumably because I had searched for it on their Marketplace, an ad popped up for what I was looking for on Facebook. I clicked on it and entered all my information including my AMX card. The order never went through and it became apparent that it was a scam. I ended up having to cancel my credit card, but all my personal information was entered on the site. My thinking was that FB had vetted their advertiser. Think again. Then, there is no one to contact. I filled out a complaint, but no one got back to me. 
Then I find what I want on Marketplace. I drove over an hour away to purchase the tool. When I got it home, it turned out to be faulty. I contacted the seller and was told too bad I already spent the money. Again, no support like you get on EBay etc. I will never buy anything from them.

"In the past few years the censoring of conservative opinions has become intolerable. Posts you dont like are taken down and we get the message our posts violated community standards. As far as I can tell your community standards are a joke. And yet you, Mark Zuckerberg went before a congressional committee and stated Facebook did not censor when in fact it does.  The updates meant to improve your app have made it user unfriendly. Posts used to appear in chronological order and now theyre all over the place. I no longer see posts from all my friends just the same 25-30. Another irritant are so called Fact Checkers, who upon inspection turn out to be biased against conservatives. And finally several times I have reported a person for impersonating another person only to be informed that person didnt violate any rule. For example, tonight I received a reply to a post asking me how I was doing. I checked the profile. The picture was that of an American Army general. I dont know any Army generals. I blocked him rather than report it because I knew that would be useless. Unfortunately these people are scammers and prey on women mostly. These people hijack information and photos from real persons without actually hacking the account. Granted its the job of the one being scammed to decline a suspicious friend request or comment. But when reported it should be taken seriously. Finally, Facebook used to be a great app to use. Sadly and annoyingly it isnt anymore.

"So, around 24 hours ago, i got logged out of my Fb account saying something like my session expired.When i tryed login back, its either saying wrong password or saying something like - i entered slightly wrong phone nr but they fix it and i still have to put the password for extra security! 
I have not changed ever in 12 years my password and now says its wrong. 

When i put that i forgat the password, it led me to an email i deleted long ago replacing with a new one, however the new one looks like disappeared so i tryed give an other email ..
And here comes the most interesting: it did ask me for a picture in real time of my ID to confirm my identity and it mentioned that the ID photo will be kept in their system for 30 days before deleting..

First of all how you will confirm my identity with my ID if you never had it in first place when i registered for FB, second of all why out of the blue you asking for it, third why would you keep it for 30 days and fourth of all why would you think i will give it to you when i know how poor is your security system and you dont even have Costumer Service to help with matters like this ! 

Then just a moment ago i saw my name slightly changing. So i would assume at this point that my profile got hacked!

"In my opinion, Facebook has expertly farmed user data to effectively target advertising to users.  On the surface, this is to be expected.  However, the depth to which big data is being collected and used through a platform designed to manipulate users emotions is both incredibly cynical and has shown to be most harmful to social discourse and cohesion by leveraging our worst tendencies against ourselves and our fellow citizens at immense profits to Facebook.  The moral compass of silicon valley has demonstrated egregious abuse of public trust.  Users of social media platforms need to take back control of their data and these organizations need to be broken up.  Or, they can WAKE UP, atone, and re-organize themselves toward a morally responsible role in society and democracy.",4,opinion facebook expertli farm user data effect target advertis user surfac expect howev depth big data collect use platform design manipul user emot incred cynic shown harm social discours cohes leverag worst tendenc fellow citizen immens profit facebook moral compass silicon valley demonstr egregi abus public trust user social medium platform need take back control data organ need broken wake aton reorgan toward moral respons role societi democraci

"Deleted the app and profile. After having a profile for 15 years, I decided to move on and away from the political nonsense I had to see from friends and family about national and international issues that had nothing to do with them on a daily basis. 

I was also tired of the constant push for assurance from people to feel a certain way about everything. It started to feel like a forum in a way. Like if you didnt agree with a majority of people you would find yourself arguing with strangers who dont know your life. It started to feel a little too cliquey for me. 

For the first few years it was fun. Coming from MySpace with the fun and keep in touch attitude, it was easy to connect with friends, family and coworkers alike. In my opinion, after everyones parents and even grandparents got on it, it was nothing but annoying and still is to this day.  I dont wanna look forward to radically charged political opinions every 2-4 years in my face telling me what I need to do and try to persuade me to think a certain way to benefit others and not myself. It was like watching the news everyday but it never gets better. 

As for friends. All people do these days are spy on you and stalk you online but avoid you in a grocery store or act weird in person. Nobody is really authentic in person anymore because of online social medias. People would rather receive likes and attention over real friendship and its easy to see that on Facebook. 

Also the Ads were the most annoying experience. I know they keep it free but they turn around and sell all your information and you get more ads in your email and other Facebook owned apps. I literally had to delete and select no to a list of things when I deleted my profile and Im glad I did. 

Another little thing that bothered me was accidentally seeing spoiler alerts I would get from pop culture fan pages about a big movie I wanted to see or a simple meme a friend would share and ruin it for me. So unnecessary. 

I dont care if anyone actually read this, just wanted to vent a little. so far life is less stressful with out it. ?",4,delet app profil profil 15 year decid move away polit nonsens see friend famili nation intern issu noth daili basi also tire constant push assur peopl feel certain way everyth start feel like forum way like didnt agre major peopl would find argu stranger dont know life start feel littl cliquey first year fun come myspac fun keep touch attitud easi connect friend famili cowork alik opinion everyon parent even grandpar got noth annoy still day dont wan na look forward radic charg polit opinion everi 24 year face tell need tri persuad think certain way benefit other like watch news everyday never get better friend peopl day spi stalk onlin avoid groceri store act weird person nobodi realli authent person anymor onlin social medium peopl would rather receiv like attent real friendship easi see facebook also ad annoy experi know keep free turn around sell inform get ad email facebook own app liter delet select list thing delet profil im glad anoth littl thing bother accident see spoiler alert would get pop cultur fan page big movi want see simpl meme friend would share ruin unnecessari dont care anyon actual read want vent littl far life le stress

"(?????????)Facebook used to be fun place to connect with old school friends and family.. a place where I could freely express my unique self. You used to be able to post anything you wanted whether it was true or not, just because you felt like it and nobody really cared! Some things opened up great discussions! Now, everything you share or comment is scrutinized by behind-the screen random, ghost people. These people have their own options and when you freely express yourself like before, your posts or comments will be taken down, blocked or hidden, and all of your audience will be notified that your opinion or post just happens to be something they personally disagree with. I did a test and posted 2 polar opposite opinions on a issue just to see what they would do, both of them were false news. The fake news I posted about current and political events had 2 distinct viewpoints. The one the ghost person disagree with, was covered up and labeled as false with a link to an article for my audience to click proving their viewpoint. The other one that was also fake news, fit their personal viewpoint and they never touched it.

"I started on Facebook in 2009 and began to use it for many different things including business and friends and meeting new people. When I arrived I was welcomed to the mothership.

It became a very exciting place because I got to learn about the world and discuss topics and even started my own study group which now has been taken down. 

I have been suspended permanently and banned off of the platform because I showed many things that were true that they did not like. They being Facebook. 

Facebook has become a spy op big brother just like 1984 warned us about. They have censored peoples views and stopped people expressing themselves and are controlling the rhetoric and dialogue of freedom speaking Americans right here in the San Francisco Bay area of all places! 

They are a disgusting operation run by horrible people who are bent on their own explicit agenda and not one ounce of true American values anymore. 

 I lost three business pages many groups which I had started of up to 5000 people and counting and was removed off of the platform without any choice or recourse and so were many of my friends just because we backed President Trump.  

All of my studies for five years disappeared and were hidden by their so-called fact checkers who are just not the implants and part of the controlling of free speech.  

The Nuremberg code needs to be implemented on this nefarious bunch immediately! 

 They are CCP and infiltrated the United States and have waged a crew on the US government with a false president and hacking our election. 

Twitter is in on it too and these two should be strung up by their toenails pronto. And my American friends are sick to death of this infiltration of the American dream. 

They are international criminals and have waged war on the world through their platform and we are not going to put up with it anymore.  What started out as a creative venture has turned into a backbiting narcissistic control operative buy some wannabee cool ppl who are actually a buncha nerds. I agree with many of the new reviews here that say if I could give a negative rating or zero rating I would.

"I have been on Facebook since early 2009 and am spending less time on it the last year. I am a conservative and have many friends who are conservatives. We are all planning to leave Facebook due to censoring of conservatives and what they have pulled to sway the 2020 election. Democrats are never censored and their posts are not fact checked, but conservatives are fact checked and censored too often. We feel our free speech has been taken from us. Our first amendment right is being squelched. This is tyranny by Mark Zuckerberg to attain his own goals. We all know it and he will miss us when we are gone because the businesses that advertise on FB  wont pay to not have millions of people not there to purchase their products.

"(?????????)Facebook is an Orwellian platform.  It censors free speech under the guise of hate speech. It censors truth in favor of spreading propaganda lies (i.e. suppressing 2020 USA President election fraud, Joe and Hunter Biden scandals, political adds stating biological facts vs political correct gender ideology, covid information differing from the WHO/UN despite the UN/WHO and their puppets being wrong multiple times).   It also violates peoples privacy and sell the information.   They go on then lie about the censorship to congress which does nothing about it.  It censored and suppressed small business paid advertising, which they allege was an accident.  This app is more for communist China than it is for a free America.

"I hate Facebook, and PayPal, so bad. Even when I reached out for support, after my account was hacked and money was used for a purchase by the hackersfrom my personal bank account, Facebook did little to NOTHING to protect my interest. 
Whoever hacked my account purchased something and it was withdrawn from my bank account through PayPal. This happened after my account was hacked and had already been reported, to pay for something the hackers got from Facebook.
When Facebook failed to communicate with me, I went through PayPal to file a dispute. Well lo and behold, after the supposed investigation Paypal sided with Facebook on the charges belonging to mewhich they didnt. Therefore, there was nothing more they could about that. 
I had to jump through a lot of hoops to recover the account, since the hackers successfully managed to change my email address on my account to their email address on the account and I had no way to verify it at that point. All communication would be funneled to their email address.
Please understand me when I tell you I was very disrespected. This was absolutely something out of my control. I reported it to you, and you (Facebook)still would not support me with just trying to get those few lil dollars back. Money that absolutely needed but  those hackers probably would have never missed.

"(?????????)*UPDATE* after going through the annoying ad section THAT YOU CANNOT TURN OFF! I have hidden over 3 thousand ads...and guess what..literally every three posts..every three..there is an ad. And I am talking about very specific stuff Ive talked about in messages like texting and Facebook messenger. So what happened to them not datamining us? Sucker burger is nothing but a lying nazi who is stealing peoples information and selling it to advertisers 

First of all when Facebook dating came out I LOVED it, 100% better then any other site Ive used. But now me and 100s of others have been getting the error its not you, its us or try taking a break. I would come on after 1-2 days and click like on one person and instantly get that error. Ive uninstalled the app, updated the app, logged out and in, cleared the cache and still have it after a week. USELESS!!!!

Second the people who run the app of looking at the reports are useless, there was a picture of a penis on my news feed and when I reported it I got a this doesnt go against community standards. People posting brand new pages that are completely fake, advertising they are a celebrity or doing a give away and to give their credit card info. Facebook allows people to be scammed and their support team will allow these pages to stay up and will not take the reporting seriously.

Third which is the biggest...THE ADS!!! Oh god there is at least 3 ads in everyones videos, literally every time you scroll down after 3 posts from friends there is a sponsor ad. There is NO option to hide all ads, no option to skim them down. They have a section where you can hide certain ads but guess what...the moment you do that it will replace that ad with another one. This site clearly still is using peoples private information, its allowing people to get scammed and its allowing people to make threats, post nudity and pick and choose what to ban. Actually my friends account got banned for saying god bless your family and he was banned for a week. I told him he should make a law suit against Facebook for religious sensory!

No they want you to use their app. Facebook app does not communicate with messenger well often confusing because it interrupts the transition by wanting your phone number and then you lose the person and you have to go back into Facebook so you can remember how to spell their name then go back and try and find it then you can't find the person. It's just a complete failure. if I can go on, today I made a couple changes in my phone that over the past I've changed and I've never had a problem but now today I couldn't even log into Facebook.

Try to get them to do something.

"Where do I even begin?

For one, the app is absolute garbage. You cant find crap on there. It takes two hours to rummage through the settings to find privacy settings for your profile and whatnot. Not to mention that Facebook spies on you and sells your personal information to third parties for profit. 

That is a gripe I have of them, but not THE gripe Im writing about. This gripe is about either facebooks auto moderator, or even an actual person who is employed to watch certain peoples profiles (I dont know how they do it). 

Last year, there was an argument on a group Im a part of about the current pandemic. It seemed to be a pretty open debate, so I weighed in with my opinions. Within this debate, there were people with some very radical ideas, while I was basically trying to explain that there needs to be a better way to get information we need from the source, without the news media being the middle man so we could get all the information we need without any twisting of the facts for propagandas sake. 

Well, my comment was removed, and I was given a 24 hour ban. Yeah, they just completely skipped the warning and immediately hit me with the ban. 

Fast forward a few months, and somebody was calling me some expletives and saying pretty mean things. Im not one to report people on the internet, because cmon its the internet. I rebutted with some pretty clean words such as stupid, dumb, crappy person, etc. 
Well, my comment was removed and I was hit with a 7 day ban, while their comment stayed. 

Fast forward a couple more months, somebody was explaining something going on with their car. I say well thats stupid and boom, 30 day ban. 

Well here we are again, a month or so later, and the same crap just happened again for the same reason.

"(?????????)8 days ago, someone was able to log in to Snapchat account from India (I am based in the US). They successfully logged in from an unknown device, removed my email address and my phone number and proceed to scam my family and friends for $100 Amazon gift cards. I have submitted multiple tickets to Snapchat within that time and all Ive gotten is an automated reply. No one has looked in to my account or even attempted to assist me. I sent them a screenshot of the scam, because a friend sent it to me. Multiple people have reported my account and guess what its still active. This person has had access to my contacts, videos and photos for 8 days while the Snapchat support team ignores me. I created a Twitter hoping that I could get a response from their Twitter account. I finally got a response- after 5 days- they told me to be patient. After 7 days they told me they couldnt assist me over Twitter and to check my junk inbox for a reply from their team. I went through the process of creating a Twitter just to get a response from their company, dont you think Ive been neurotically checking my inbox and junk folder??? Ive opened up new tickets and responded to the original ones and still nothing. Now I guess this hacker just has free rein of my information till the end of time. Ive given up and have absolutely no interest in even using their platform anymore. Just be aware of whos hands youre putting your information in. Make sure theres no sensitive information on your Snapchat account and especially no pictures someone could use to exploit you.

"This is one of the worst apps Ive ever seen. Its advertised as this great way of connecting with your friends and loved ones but in reality its just a data collecting middleman between us, the consumers, and advertising companies. Every heard when something is free, youre the product? The app is designed to be impossible to put down, constantly sucking the user deeper into content rabbit holes by mining our usage data. Every click, every react button, every second the user spends on the app is tracked and used to customize the content to prevent the user from putting it down and used to send us the perfect ad, which advertisers pay top dollar for. Its the digital version of cigarette branding; a promise of one thing but a reality of horrors no consumer would ever imagine. Of the many side effects of using this app which include depression, anxiety, detachment from reality, etc, is the tearing apart of society as we know it. The app is designed solely to collect data and keep you hooked so it cares nothing that people are much more likely to click on things they hate than things they love, slowly but surely pushing each of us into smaller and smaller, angrier and angrier echo chambers. Detached from reality and consuming our own echos (customized content), our society is slowly torn apart as the communication lines between each echo chamber disintegrate further. Every social issue, every human experience is distilled to a data point, a thumbs up or a sarcastic laughing emoji, a click or a scroll. It is a nightmare Kafka himself could have never imagined: a violent melding of human, digital interface, and advertiser into one monstrous, self-serving, self-consuming entity. Every moment we spend hating our fellow man and seeking the dopamine rush of approval in the form of likes, is a second lost to us and a dollar gained by Facebook. Every time we click on or repost things that feel true because we agree with them (which Facebook knows, thats why it showed that link to you), a stitch in the fabric of our democracy, our society, is torn. And when it is torn, Facebook profits and shows you more of what you want to see. This app is terrible and is actively participating, encouraging for its own gain, the downfall of modern mankind. It also doesnt have a dislike button which is annoying. 0/5 stars, Mark.",4,one worst app ive ever seen advertis great way connect friend love one realiti data collect middleman u consum advertis compani everi heard someth free your product app design imposs put constantli suck user deeper content rabbit hole mine usag data everi click everi react button everi second user spend app track use custom content prevent user put use send u perfect ad advertis pay top dollar digit version cigarett brand promis one thing realiti horror consum would ever imagin mani side effect use app includ depress anxieti detach realiti etc tear apart societi know app design sole collect data keep hook care noth peopl much like click thing hate thing love slowli sure push u smaller smaller angrier angrier echo chamber detach realiti consum echo custom content societi slowli torn apart commun line echo chamber disintegr everi social issu everi human experi distil data point thumb sarcast laugh emoji click scroll nightmar kafka could never imagin violent meld human digit interfac advertis one monstrou selfserv selfconsum entiti everi moment spend hate fellow man seek dopamin rush approv form like second lost u dollar gain facebook everi time click repost thing feel true agre facebook know that show link stitch fabric democraci societi torn torn facebook profit show want see app terribl activ particip encourag gain downfal modern mankind also doesnt dislik button annoy 05 star mark

"This is a Public service announcement and a review about Facebook the company better known as Facebook has flagged my email and has disabled my account for no reason at all. Example I went two whole weeks without using Facebook messenger or any associated app or website, I was dormant in using the app and as soon as I logged in I was logged back out automatically and notified I violated their community guidelines. Once I was put on notice I had the option to file a request for a  review of my account where I was then asked to upload a picture of my photo ID, so I managed to regain access to delete that account and created a new account under a different email and two days later was automatically signed out of my account  yet again and was notified that I was using multiple accounts and had to confirm the account I had deleted or permanently loose the account I had just made. I would not recommend this social platform for anybody because they track you using GEO location on your phone, monitor your microphone, and camera, and watch you 24/7  they require your physical address, phone number, and email, they require you to upload a photo ID or birth certificate. Meta previously known as Facebook is in association with 3rd party corporations in China where they take all data collected on you and sell it to big businesses and profit off your rights to use their services. They monitor each like, comment, and message made through Facebook app or messenger. It is not safe and idk why its even legal to use in the United States. As far as Im concerned Facebook is a CIA platform and is only free to the public to monitor and track each person online. They even monitor you when you arent using their app. As long as you have the app downloaded on your device regardless online or offline they still watch and monitor you, they track your microphone and your camera so Id be advised and delete the app, go to something else like MySpace, or something.",4,public servic announc review facebook compani better known facebook flag email disabl account reason exampl went two whole week without use facebook messeng associ app websit dormant use app soon log log back automat notifi violat commun guidelin put notic option file request review account ask upload pictur photo id manag regain access delet account creat new account differ email two day later automat sign account yet notifi use multipl account confirm account delet perman loo account made would recommend social platform anybodi track use geo locat phone monitor microphon camera watch 247 requir physic address phone number email requir upload photo id birth certif meta previous known facebook associ 3rd parti corpor china take data collect sell big busi profit right use servic monitor like comment messag made facebook app messeng safe idk even legal use unit state far im concern facebook cia platform free public monitor track person onlin even monitor arent use app long app download devic regardless onlin offlin still watch monitor track microphon camera id advis delet app go someth el like myspac someth

"Interesting how Facebook can link all your personal data to everything out there leaving you wide open, but when it comes to censoring information ? They try to force their beliefs and opinions  on you that are not based on facts or science.  They rely on Google for information? Google is also owned and controlled by those with an agenda. Dont believe me? Learn how to research. Its the epitome of hypocrisy.  Facebook cannot differentiate between real journalism and hyperbole and try to force their opinions on you.

"Lets face it, FB is a social engineering dream come true. You get users to upload pictures, share their favorite thoughts/ideas, and interact with other users to gather data to sell go advertisers. Moreover, the biggest data client of FB is likely numerous governments across the world seeking to track and control their citizens. If this isnt the dystopian nightmare George Orwell warned us about, Im not sure what could be a better example. 

We use FB to inform families of births, deaths, birthdays, celebrations, and every aspect of our lives, believing we are interacting socially with those we choose to share with. FB preys upon our emotions, manipulates us into becoming politically tribal, and generally exploits the precious moments of our lives to make money. You are the product, and the more you are manipulated into interacting, the more money you generate for people who honestly dont care whether you live or die. 

They have successfully engineered entire populations to voluntarily disclose their lives to the world, oblivious to nefarious actors, oblivious to the fact they are being used to fill the pockets of those who have invested in FB. You thought you were a person using a social network, but you are just a cog in a machine that must be exploited. 

FB, like Twitter and Google, are technofascists who align with brutal regimes across the world to silence dissent, control political narratives, and inevitably perpetual structural violence upon Othered populations. They do not value freedom of speech or autonomy; and God help you if you utter something that does not align with the views shared by those in charge of FB.

"Incredibly addictive. No control over your own account. If someone hacks your account there is literally no way to retrieve it. They give you an option to send in a selfie video to prove the account is yours, but that video will get denied over and over again. Even if you account has photos or videos of your face.  That being said someone else has access to your personal photos of your family or baby and can do what ever they'd like with them. Instagrams response to this is basically ????? ..good luck..

I like Snapchat and everything because of the fun filters and the point that you can FaceTime and stuff like that. But I have noticed a lot of people telling me that random people are friending them and that they have a public story. It usually shows them old man who drink. And Im quite worried and this is why I dont use it anymore because my cousin who has been using Snapchat for a very long time seen this guy viewing her story. She look at his story it showed pictures of a very old man who drinks and smokes. In my very own opinion Snapchat should be 15+ and if someone wants an acc or to log on Snapchat should ask for their Parents email and once the child makes an acc or logs in the parent should get the email. That should also go down for any notifications or requests from other strangers.

"So, the Pages section of this app isnt one of the better operating sections. I have a lot of nitpicks, but Im going to focus on one major complaint. 

My main problem comes from the Page News Feed, where when I try to comment or like a post from a page I follow on the page I run, it comments or likes from my personal account. I also have this problem a lot of the time when replying to comments, and often times have no option to change what name Im commenting or liking under. 

The problem with replies was easily remedied with the Business Suite app, (that I feel would be much better off as a dedicated app for FB Pages,) the issue of the news feed is still a problem as the Business Suite app doesnt let us see our pages news feed. 

All and all, I think FB pages would benefit greatly from the FB Gaming treatment, with an app entirely dedicated to FB pages with full incorporation of a news feed. The Business Suite app could stay around for its current purpose of managing business pages, but I believe FB pages still need their own app. 

I didnt have Facebook Page Manager prior to it being changed to Business Suite, so I ave no knowledge of whether or not this was already a thing, but it should be. 

Another way to quickly and easily fix this, while avoiding revamping or creating a new app, would be to put the option to change whether were commenting under the page or our personal account in the text bar, similar to that of the emoji, gif, and photo options.",2,page section app isnt one better oper section lot nitpick im go focu one major complaint main problem come page news feed tri comment like post page follow page run comment like person account also problem lot time repli comment often time option chang name im comment like problem repli easili remedi busi suit app feel would much better dedic app fb page issu news feed still problem busi suit app doesnt let u see page news feed think fb page would benefit greatli fb game treatment app entir dedic fb page full incorpor news feed busi suit app could stay around current purpos manag busi page believ fb page still need app didnt facebook page manag prior chang busi suit ave knowledg whether alreadi thing anoth way quickli easili fix avoid revamp creat new app would put option chang whether comment page person account text bar similar emoji gif photo option

I\'ve been on Facebook since it first went online back in 2004, and I cannot stress enough just how far down this platform - originally created to bring people together - has fallen. Everything is totally broken. Comments are all out of order. My pages are all misplaced. People comment on my pages, and I cant see any of their comments unless I go on my computer. Your horrifically needy \""user agreement\"" is an absolute JOKE, where people have to basically let you bend them over a table before they can even create an account, just for you to turn around and SELL their data. AND DON\'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE. Apple has a customer service line. Microsoft has a customer service line. Even Comcast (ugh) has a customer service line. Facebook? No customer service line, WHATSOEVER. It\'s infuriating. I\'ve had my account disabled over NOTHING, because your garbage algorithms are incapable of quantifying CONTEXT. Which is pretty scary, when you think about it.. I hate Facebook so, SO much - and I can\'t wait for them to get their comeuppance - as it is long, LONG overdue. Take a hike, you fascists.

Sadly my account was hacked - a security breach in the hands of Facebook.  But who is the one that pays the price?  Me and many others.  I had been with Facebook for 15 years - documenting my childrens adventures and mine only to have it all stripped away with no help whatsoever from them.  I have tried contacting and following the steps to get my account back.  But all I got was not only my personal account disabled but my business accounts that I paid for on Facebook and Instagram disabled as well because they were linked.  They know I was hacked yet they took all of my accounts away.  And now the app wont even work for my new account.  For one of the richest companies in the world they have the absolute worst customer service.  I am disappointed that I invested so much of my life into the site.  I have lost all of the memories of when my kids said something funny or did something for the first time - photos that I thought I would have forever.  Shame on you Facebook.

"1.) Facebook has spent years perfecting the art of making users think they have control over their privacy by putting in a few visible controls while constantly adding new undisclosed tools that default to sharing information and tracking users. This pattern means at least once a month, users should be checking all privacy and security settings (which are numerous and onerous), but which they know users wont do. By playing whack-a-mole privacy settings, FB has collected trillions of data points on hundreds of millions of active daily users. They disingenuously continue to pledge transparency but never have provided it.

2.) Facebook has for years failed to set clear guidelines for what it will censor and what it wont. More often than not it treats harmful content as free speech and free speech as harmful content. Tue bottom line is always whether the act of censoring a thing will cost their bottom line. If an individual is being bullied, they will do nothing. If something someone posts is a neutral express of art or humanity, they act on vaguely worded policies prohibiting content that shows nudity or other ultra-conservative-sensibility offending content. Theres usually little rhyme or reason other than the opinion of an overworked, traumatized worker on the other side of the planet from the United States. Bottom Line: Facebook is a dishonest broker. They prioritize profit over factual information, and incentivize bullying through lax enforcement policies.",2,1 facebook spent year perfect art make user think control privaci put visibl control constantli ad new undisclos tool default share inform track user pattern mean least month user check privaci secur set numer oner know user wont play whackamol privaci set fb collect trillion data point hundr million activ daili user disingenu continu pledg transpar never provid 2 facebook year fail set clear guidelin censor wont often treat harm content free speech free speech harm content tue bottom line alway whether act censor thing cost bottom line individu bulli noth someth someon post neutral express art human act vagu word polici prohibit content show nuditi ultraconservativesens offend content there usual littl rhyme reason opinion overwork traumat worker side planet unit state bottom line facebook dishonest broker priorit profit factual inform incentiv bulli lax enforc polici

"Facebook often gets crashed, uses unnumbered ads, irritating videos, allows spammers and hackers use fake links and phishing nets. It takes away huge internet data as its an unnecessary bulky app which is only for making room for ads providers so that Zukerberg and his company can earn huge money. It lets easy data breeches and makes users vulnerable. It never compensates for the important data loss of the users, making them sensibly porne to be hacked and spammed. 
Facebook is a very disgusting app with low quality video, floods of ads, irritating pages, storms of fake news, vulnerable and fragile security systems. It runs after only money selling users data and delivering them without informing its users and consent. Data robbing and selling to third part makes it impossible to protect ones personal information and financial security when the hackers break through users sensitive information and password. Again, it never admits or compensates users information robbery or ensures their privacy. It id often seen, Facebook itself sells data to third parties willingly to make money. Its a all bogus system of adhering people to eating out their importa and valuable time, and often let publish hate speech and pervert newa without verification which causes rise to hate to minorities, small gropi of people and ethnic groups.

"(?????????)*UPDATE* after going through the annoying ad section THAT YOU CANNOT TURN OFF! I have hidden over 3 thousand ads...and guess what..literally every three posts..every three..there is an ad. And I am talking about very specific stuff Ive talked about in messages like texting and Facebook messenger. So what happened to them not datamining us? Sucker burger is nothing but a lying nazi who is stealing peoples information and selling it to advertisers First of all when Facebook dating came out I LOVED it, 100% better then any other site Ive used. But now me and 100s of others have been getting the error its not you, its us or try taking a break. I would come on after 1-2 days and click like on one person and instantly get that error. Ive uninstalled the app, updated the app, logged out and in, cleared the cache and still have it after a week. USELESS!!!! Second the people who run the app of looking at the reports are useless, there was a picture of a penis on my news feed and when I reported it I got a this doesnt go against community standards. People posting brand new pages that are completely fake, advertising they are a celebrity or doing a give away and to give their credit card info. Facebook allows people to be scammed and their support team will allow these pages to stay up and will not take the reporting seriously. Third which is the biggest...THE ADS!!! Oh god there is at least 3 ads in everyones videos, literally every time you scroll down after 3 posts from friends there is a sponsor ad. There is NO option to hide all ads, no option to skim them down. They have a section where you can hide certain ads but guess what...the moment you do that it will replace that ad with another one. This site clearly still is using peoples private information, its allowing people to get scammed and its allowing people to make threats, post nudity and pick and choose what to ban. Actually my friends account got banned for saying god bless your family and he was banned for a week. I told him he should make a law suit against Facebook for religious sensory!

"I just created a profile after months. I deleted my old account as I felt fb was into my life too much. Plus most of the suggestions were very segregated as I only had access to people who look like me despite the diversity in my personal life. I had my old account since 2015. Anyways, I created a profile just 20 minutes ago. I put a facebook cover up of my business like Ive always done in the past. Didnt put a profile pic up yet as I wanted to put one up that was really liked. I modified some settings and decided Ill come back after a break to finish. Facebook sent me an e-mail 5 minutes after signing out saying my account was disabled for breaking community guidelines. There are so many ways to connect with people in the world without this platform. If I immediately posted all of my personal information I guarantee my profile would still be up and running.

I deleted Facebook three weeks ago and switched to mewe. I went through and screen recorded all of my personal videos I uploaded from years ago from old phones I had lost their memory. I screen shot all the photos I needed and deactivated my account. I will delete it after all my groups from messenger are attended to. This app is garbage. I am constantly censored as well as many of my friends. I am unable to post anything that is true because it gets flagged as false information. Since when is someones opinion true or false or false information? Why are you so obsessed with controlling peoples freedom of speech suddenly? Why is the election process suddenly something Facebook is an expert on? Why is it suddenly that conservatives and people who believe in their freedoms the ones who are selfish for not thinking about other people I didnt just fight for this country to see Facebook destroy it.

"I absolutely despise that my profile has been changed to display all my pictures as rectangles. My posts were specifically formatted to look good as squares, and it has turned me off even opening the app now. Its frustrating to see years of carefully curated aesthetic dumped down the drain because execs care more about promoting reels. I would rather have a tab only for reels that was formatted rectangularly or at least an option to change back to the original format in my personal settings. Being able to edit previews does nothing to fix this problem, especially when it results in poorly cropped photos where half the picture is cut off and someone is no longer visible. I disliked this update from the moment it rolled out, and refrained from making a comment until now in hopes that it would be fixed, but clearly that is not the case.

"About a week ago, my account was hacked. They changed all of my information. Now Facebook is forcing me to send them videos and private information to log back in. I say forcing because they arent giving me any other option other than this, theyre asking for social numbers, papers will bills, or physical proof scanning my face. They made it so easy for the hacker to get into my account but will not let me- the actual owner of the account. They arent providing any help, they need me to send them the generator code but the only way to receive it is by logging in and going to my settings. Tell me, how am I supposed to log in if Facebook kicked me out of ALL of my accounts leaving me no access whatsoever. Ive reported the account hacked and so have many other people/devices. They havent temporarily shut down the account or anything thatll help the situation, the account shows as still active. Now that I made a new account for the time-being they shut it down (new account) due to community guidelines. The whole process isnt helping the account owner. Sure this may seem secure but where was the security when the hacker got into my account with easy access?- There were no, unknown account- need proof in order to log in. Because if they did that and were acting as extra as they are on me, we wouldnt be here. Tell me how this is actually professional?!? They let someone hack my account, and I the actual owner showing so much proof. They will not let me get access. I cant get into my account, I cant receive the generator code, without the same code I cant get into my account. See how that makes sense?

I got a warning over this and there was nothing that bad in it. Conversation I had been going on all day and my friend was out to dinner and it continued on FB and others jumped in.

"I am not an overly political person, if I could say that I affiliate with anything I would definitely be in the middle. But the political agenda thats forced on us on Facebook is just absolutely ridiculous. If you say things that they dont approve of, the algorithms will not work in your favor. Theres a rating/ranking system going on now, sounds just like China. But on a smaller scale. If we let these bigwigs win, it might end up being just like China. Its so odd but true, Facebook is like its own country. 

Thankfully Im my own boss, I dont have to worry about being politically correct. There was a time where I was applying for jobs, and every business would ask me if I had a Facebook. When I told them that I didnt have one at that time, (I was on and off Facebook), they would think that it was weird or suspicious. I really wish people would just get to know you, have a conversation talk over the phone instead of relying on social media where you see the best of everybody. Its so fake. And its not teaching people to communicate properly. Especially bad for children who need to learn that!

I am first generation in USA from the Netherlands, so I was using Facebook to keep in touch with family . But now Im just so scared and apprehensive to use it that I just signed off and this will probably be the final time. I dont like how they infringe on your privacy and the amount of ads is just ridiculous now. Data mining, data mining, and more data mining. I freaking hate that!

"(?????????)My account information was recently used in the black web unbeknownst to my knowledge. After finding out this information took immediate action to update and change my account information to prevent any future attempts and in doing so I now constantly receive the warning message of not being able to like/ care in an image and not able to post any comments. What gives Facebook seriously? If I have taken the necessary steps to secure my account why cant you take the necessary steps  to fix the template (program bugs) that keeps popping up every single time I log into my account. This has been going on for the past 90 days and it is beyond annoying. I have to log in five or six times to even view one post or reply to a friend that has sent me a message. This used to be an amazing platform to use but it has since turned into hackers central, an unfavorable forum for black groups to use successfully without being censored and banned for what Facebook deems politically inappropriate material (posting factual information regarding any and all black history facts). But still to date have not censored or removed any of the white supremacy groups who continually spread their toxic rhetoric and/or post their photos of racial improprieties.

"So Facebook is complaining about Apple\'s privacy demands. How ironic is that? FB does not respect anybody\'s privacy, they make billions collecting and selling people\'s personal information, and they are complaining that Apple has too much power, really? Haha, funny!

Good thing ai use fake names and VPN\'s when I use them and block as many privacy setting set up to block FB as much as I can.

\""Saying that you don\'t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide. It\'s no different than saying you don\'t care about freedom of speech because you have nothing to say.

Facebook is obviously politically one sided. If they dont like an article you post they say their fact checkers checked it and said its false. They are fine with people calling you the C word or someone making fun of your disabled child but you cant say anything negative about one side of the political party even without using foul language or they will delete it. Ive seen the most foul language used about the other side and that doesnt go against their standards.

How so unfortunate that he is so willing to forfeit his own integrity and his creations integrity. Oh, wait, he possessed little integrity to begin with!

"Facebook censors anyone whose views they do not agree with.  
They block such targeted individuals and others from accessing their own Facebook accounts; but requires that any appeal regarding Facebooks apparent arbitrary action be submitted by the user through the users account in order to have their case reviewed.  A catch twenty-two blocking the person from resolving whatever it was that initiated Facebooks action.  
There is no customer service department to contact about any issue, outside of having to do so through ones online Facebook account.  
Furthermore, there is no telephone or email or chat access to a customer service agent for addressing any issue concerning Facebook, unlike more reputable businesses.  
One is thereby locked out of contacting Facebook about such issues without having to do so from ones account, which one has  been banned access to.  Such action being taken by Facebook without any explanation as to why being proved to the blocked user.  
One is left to guess why one has been locked out of their own Facebook account.  
A most frustrating and fruitless experience.  
Facebook is not worth the headache.  
Why put up with having to walk on eggshells on ones account, hoping that one does not step on Facebooks toes.   
Facebook policies, though published, are vague enough for them to interpret them in any way and at any time that suits their own purposes, in what ever situation that may  arise.   
Facebook seems to hold that such published policies fulfills what they view as their responsibility to the users of their so called service.  
Such business practices would seem to be more self-serving to their own biases. 
All of the above is my own personal opinion.  
I truly wish that I had first checked the 1000+ reviews of Facebook on the Better Business Bureau (BBB) website.  
The reviews of Facebook filed with the BBB were most illuminating.  Something I stumbled upon when I went to the BBB website to submit my own review.  Unfortunately this insight gained from the BBB website came after the fact.  It certainly would have given me pause before choosing whether get involved with them, or not.  
Were there an alternative social media to using this unregulated internet monopoly (Facebook), I would happily give them a try instead.  
My advice? Proceed with utmost caution... and do not be surprised when your greatest Facebook nightmare materializes - being cutoff from an avenue of social contact with ones family and friends.  
In my opinion emails and snail mail offers a much more pleasurable and hassle free experience than does Facebook. 
Again, all of the above is my personal opinion.

Be sure to anonymously block and report the people who say something that you dont like. No need to face your conflict. Just cancel them and make them go away! Want to lurk on your new neighbors? Just add them on zuckbook and follow them on the Instagram and WhatsApp - all the same thing as you know - and they brought Orwellian ideology to life!

Good luck trying to opt out of the invasion of cookies and tracking with third parties and marketing affiliates - you empower a trillion dollar data brokerage economy when you use this platform. The normalization of the raping of your privacy and personal data is unconscionable. 
Because there is no universally recognized standard for how to interpret do not track (DNT) signals we do not currently have the ability to recognize that from your browser or device unique identifier which we track anyways. 

Consent is consent. Facebook doesnt care if you give them consent. You dont get to have a say. Opting out is a joke. And they know it. 

That platform is used to re-target and control.. you through behavioral tracking and advertising.

"(?????????)When FB started out it didnt seem all that bad. A place to connect with long lost friends, post your thoughts, the things you liked. 

But that wasnt really the case, they smelled blood in the water. Rather they smelled an opportunity to make more money. 

The amount of data Fb takes is utterly ridiculous. What on earth do they need with all of that information? Our lives are not a commodity to be bought and sold. We are not products, we are human beings and we have a right to privacy. 

Dont download the app wonderful idea! 
Oh wait FB makes a ghost profile on you if you have any friends who do have it. I dont recall agreeing to that. It truly wasnt that long ago when ads were just that, ads. No targeting, no data mining, you just got shown the ad. They made money that way, it worked, but that wasnt enough. Why make money ethically when you can abuse peoples rights and make more money? 

You make it extremely difficult to delete profiles, and honestly I have my doubts whether or not that data is truly deleted. That makes it essentially impossible for older people, who arent tech savvy. 

Facebook, much like google, is a predatory company. Its data harvesting practices are incredibly similar to what a virus would do. Dig and gather as much data as possible so they can utilize that information to best profit off the individual theyre targeting. 

It is utterly disgusting, and a practice I hope people will wise up to. You do not have the rights to my information, to my life, to anyones life.

Cons- too many limits. Limits how many people you can PM. Why? Why is everything under the guise of them fearing spam?

On the app, it allows me to share things with all groups. It actually makes it easy. But, if I share to more groups than Facebook wants it freezes my account sharing. THEN WHY GIVE ME THAT OPTION? Maybe tell me what the magic number is of what I can share???
It is so frustrating and has hurt me saving animals because I get locked up.

They allow racism against white people and Christians all the time. That is not a concern to their community standards.
Also, the whole fact checkers thing is dumb and inaccurate. This is what takes the cake for me.

Many of the legit postings are by companies outright lying about have a product for sale and the price they are selling it for.

"The only reason my Facebook account exists is because Facebook bought out Oculus and now forces oculus VR users (wether they want to or not) to have Facebook accounts just to be able to use their systems. I wish I could say that Facebook at least improved upon the system, but unfortunately the longer they have control of the of the oculus vr system the more it feels like a digital cage where big brother controls your every move. As someone who has been an oculus user since day one I have acquired a lot of games. So until I can find a viable alternative I am stuck using this shamelessly censored and politically biased service that I have no desire what-so-ever to use. I want to make it clear that I have no intentions of using my Facebook account for social purposes. It is strictly for oculus and nothing else. I also wanna make it known that Facebook does not have my consent to utilize the cameras on my oculus headset to view anything within my house, nor do they have my consent to use the microphone in my headset to eavesdrop on me in my house. Any violation of my privacy in this manner by Facebook will likely be met with legal action. Facebook has proven time and time again that they do not truly respect their users right to privacy (they literally sell our personal data), nor do they respect their users right to free expression ( unless you are expressing views that they agree with). I am deeply offended by the fact that Facebook sees fit to force me to utilize a service that I most definitely do not want to utilize just so I can continue to utilize a service that I have been using literally since it first came out. As soon as I can find a reasonable/affordable alternative to oculus VR I assure you with absolute certainty that my Facebook account will be deleted, and every oculus headset I own ( I literally own every version Ive been with Oculus since day one) will be rendered unusable and tossed in the trash.

"Facebook has gone way to far with its targeted advertising, and invasion of privacy. They pretend to support free speech and doing what you want, but in reality they censor anything that doesnt support their political views.

My sisters account just got hacked, shes locked out, and hackers want her to send them money to get back in. She tried customer support, reporting her account.

"Facebook has become an awful place. Their new community standards say (and I quote word for word) 

4.Shocking Stories:

Content that otherwise does not violate our COVID-19 or vaccine policies above but that shares potentially or actually true events or facts that raise safety concerns, indicated by sharing personal anecdotes or news events of severe adverse events, either in hyperbolic terms or without context.

Ex: My friend got the vaccine and now has Bells Palsy, be warned!

The app and messenger sidecar constantly have issues updating, showing correct information, presenting errors, not sharing between devices, and show ""unread"" messages.
The updating issues stem from updated listing items. Items on discount don't always show to the public. I get messages that there are offers on items or that an item has sold and marketplace won't let me connect to those messages. You have to really really dig to find them. There isn't a way to filter unread messages and a whole host of notifications give you an unread message notification. If I contact someone about their item and they sell it to someone else or mark it pending I get a message notification but unless I find the exact conversation, that someone sold an item on, it remains in the corner.

"(?????????)When I first started using Facebook it was a nice way to keep in touch with friends and family. I still enjoy it for that. 

With that being said I do not enjoy being spied on by the Facebook police. I dont like that they suppress what they deem unacceptable without anyway to plead your case. Example I posted a meme about shared bathrooms. My friend commented about being able to use womens bathrooms now and being excited. My response was I wouldnt  be too excited women are disgusting. They deemed that goes against Facebook standards because I said women are disgusting. Well as a woman and an American I have every right to say that. Ive used womans bathroom for nearly a half century. I think I can honestly say theyre gross. I am now considering leaving Facebook because it is not their right to censor any American from their right to freedom of speech. Facebook needs to offer a way to plead your case because they are relying on individuals who are not qualified to judge what you post. Its communism so be careful.",2,first start use facebook nice way keep touch friend famili still enjoy said enjoy spi facebook polic dont like suppress deem unaccept without anyway plead case exampl post meme share bathroom friend comment abl use woman bathroom excit respons wouldnt excit woman disgust deem goe facebook standard said woman disgust well woman american everi right say ive use woman bathroom nearli half centuri think honestli say theyr gross consid leav facebook right censor american right freedom speech facebook need offer way plead case reli individu qualifi judg post commun care

Even for a single reply notification, it doesnt take you to the comment thread, just the post. The comment replies do not appear in order, even though they have a tree on the side, the replies do not appear in any sort of correct order.

I clicked the link to secure my account and turn in my ID and then I was directed to a page that said my account was permanently disabled. I am a cosmetologist and my main form of communication is through Facebook. I have pictures of my kids since they were born on Facebook that I no longer have on my phone because I got a new phone. I have pictures of my deceased father on my Facebook. Lets be real. Facebook is the biggest way people stay connected these days. There is absolutely no way to contact customer support. Its impenetrable. Trying to get support is like pulling teeth.

"(?????????)The only reason my Facebook account exists is because Facebook bought out Oculus and now forces oculus VR users (wether they want to or not) to have Facebook accounts just to be able to use their systems. I wish I could say that Facebook at least improved upon the system, but unfortunately the longer they have control of the of the oculus vr system the more it feels like a digital cage where big brother controls your every move. As someone who has been an oculus user since day one I have acquired a lot of games. So until I can find a viable alternative I am stuck using this shamelessly censored and politically biased service that I have no desire what-so-ever to use. I want to make it clear that I have no intentions of using my Facebook account for social purposes. It is strictly for oculus and nothing else. I also wanna make it known that Facebook does not have my consent to utilize the cameras on my oculus headset to view anything within my house, nor do they have my consent to use the microphone in my headset to eavesdrop on me in my house. Any violation of my privacy in this manner by Facebook will likely be met with legal action. Facebook has proven time and time again that they do not truly respect their users right to privacy (they literally sell our personal data), nor do they respect their users right to free expression ( unless you are expressing views that they agree with). I am deeply offended by the fact that Facebook sees fit to force me to utilize a service that I most definitely do not want to utilize just so I can continue to utilize a service that I have been using literally since it first came out. As soon as I can find a reasonable/affordable alternative to oculus VR I assure you with absolute certainty that my Facebook account will be deleted, and every oculus headset I own ( I literally own every version Ive been with Oculus since day one) will be rendered unusable and tossed in the trash. I have already transitioned to steam for all future vr game purchases in preparation for this. If they deny me my right to continue using Steam for gaming then my VR headset will simply go in the trash faster.",4,reason facebook account exist facebook bought oculu forc oculu vr user wether want facebook account abl use system wish could say facebook least improv upon system unfortun longer control oculu vr system feel like digit cage big brother control everi move someon oculu user sinc day one acquir lot game find viabl altern stuck use shamelessli censor polit bias servic desir whatsoev use want make clear intent use facebook account social purpos strictli oculu noth el also wan na make known facebook consent util camera oculu headset view anyth within hous consent use microphon headset eavesdrop hous violat privaci manner facebook like met legal action facebook proven time time truli respect user right privaci liter sell person data respect user right free express unless express view agre deepli offend fact facebook see fit forc util servic definit want util continu util servic use liter sinc first came soon find reasonableafford altern oculu vr assur absolut certainti facebook account delet everi oculu headset liter everi version ive oculu sinc day one render unus toss trash alreadi transit steam futur vr game purchas prepar deni right continu use steam game vr headset simpli go trash faster

"As the title says the Facebook app has constant glitches and errors, does not allow privacy of your viewable profile information or your browsing data from third parties, and lately it has become a tool of information suppression and promotion of propaganda. The users are the product when it comes to this app and they make absolutely sure you cannot use it innocently to connect with people and view and share content freely without having your personal info scavenged and sold and your feed injected with targeted advertising and political agendas.

So I got a new iPhone 12pro. I had all the data transferred from my old iPhone. All my apps were logged in except Facebook. I entered my password and it said incorrect password so I tried resetting my password. It then brought me to a page where it said it would send me an access code to my email address. I got the access code and typed it in and it did not work. It said unknown error. I have been dealing with this since Tuesday and it is now Friday. I guess what I am really upset about is that there has been no way for me to contact the Facebook developer to have my issue resolved. I have tried looking for a phone number or an email and there is nothing. I have been directed to the Facebook help center multiple times and there are no answered to my complicated issue. I even sent Facebook a picture of my ID twice to verify my identity and I am still not able to get into my account. I am very very unhappy with Facebook and how little they are there to help their customers that keep this app running.,2,got new iphon 12pro data transfer old iphon app log except facebook enter password said incorrect password tri reset password brought page said would send access code email address got access code type work said unknown error deal sinc tuesday friday guess realli upset way contact facebook develop issu resolv tri look phone number email noth direct facebook help center multipl time answer complic issu even sent facebook pictur id twice verifi ident still abl get account unhappi facebook littl help custom keep app run

"(?????????)The platform has become a breeding ground for political toxicity, fake news, and they censor you every time you say anything that is remotely close to being pro right-winged politically, or anything that goes against the left wing agenda. They will label anything based on evidence and fact that goes against left wing politics as false information - checked by independent fact checkers and then dont give you any sort of chance to appeal your post/picture, making the entire platform based in a political bias. 

The entire facebook platform uses location history data (down to the hour), as well as microphone data, ect, and sells your personal information that they gather from this data to 3rd party advertisers such as Wish. They then spam your feed with excessive advertsements of things that are EXTREMELY relevant to your life in general. This is called personalized advertisements.
Many apps/services do it, but facebook has an entirely malicious way of doing it, based on my experience.

 If you dont upload a picture of your face to the platform after a certain time frame of creating an account, they ask that you upload a picture of your drivers license/ ID card to confirm your identity. Facebook is in legal no position to ask for this information to confirm you are who you say. But the loopholes theyve made in their terms of service have made it to where if you accept the terms, they are no longer in the wrong for asking for this information legally, so its up to the users discretion whether or not they want to proceed.

"(?????????)Dear Facebook aka Meta,

I have been locked out of my account for months. I updated to iOS 15 and Google Authenticator duplicated my security tokens/keys. I deleted the duplicates; but, after a reboot of the device all of my Google Authenticator tokens/keys were gone.

Every other online account has been salvaged, but you, Facebook, are impossible to reach. I have submitted requests in your 500 character limit help pages to no avail. I reached out to Oculus, another Meta company, and got a real live person but they couldn't help me connect my Oculus to my Facebook account.

I have submitted multiple forms of government issued ID *numerous* times through your Checkpoint. I get a link by email, enter my password and end up in the same infinite loop through your Checkpoint. I do not have a password issue. I do not have an issue proving my identity. I have a problem due to a software issue with Google Authenticator, iOS, and your Checkpoint that doesn't know the difference between a compromised security token and a forgotten password. 

I would like my data. As the data creator I am requesting a full copy of the information, photos and all, that I imputed into your web service over the course of the last 13+ years.

Please give me my meta and all the info attached to it.

In Gratitude,

It loves to now work properly when answering questions on Messenger that are not for your personal profile.

But since iOS15, it also loves to freeze for no reason whatsoever. You just need to restart the app completely, losing anything that you were doing or the post you were reading in your news feed, you know the thing that you still cannot read in chronological order, because the algorithm has decided that.

I understand youre becoming proactive against spamming BUT your technology doesnt have the capacity to read the nuance variables of wether a link to a page being shared is actually spam!! Whenever people make false accusations online (exhibiting anger towards a person based on false information about an organization or business) I make an attempt to correct them with a link for the company or non profit so they can read this data and cross check their attack on another individual. Your AI is now constantly assuming EVERY link goes against standards when ThAts NOT the case. What youre now doing is allowing people to continue to have false information and not be corrected for the sake of this illusion of peace. Very backwards and counter productive. A thread is Dialogue driven and now youre controlling this beyond a healthy level.

"I dont mind Facebook knowing where I am connected to WiFi, I understand how WiFi works, what I do mind is that even when you deny Facebook location access it still uses your cell service location to track your location. The only way Ive found to work around this, is to deny the app cellular data access. So I guess thats good news for my cellular provider because Im not risking my location in public to be shared via Facebook. Before I disabled it, I visited an out of town candle store, before I could get home I had a friend request from a random person in another state and a request to like their new candle business on Facebook. Im sorry but this was a total blindside to me. Ive been using my iPhone without the Facebook app on my phone for years and never has a random stranger so easily been able to access my location. If you were to ask Facebook, they would say its some algorithm, and my safety was never at risk, well there is a back door to this code because 3rd parties are able to access this information to use it to purchase ads. Thats understandable but its also not right. Small businesses should have the right to advertise, but they shouldnt be able to target a persons specific location.

"(?????????)Social media is very useful, dont get me wrong. But theres a dark side also. Facebook has become ridiculously over censored. It started slowly then it was like a domino effect. Fact checkers on memes, being banned for something silly, very easy to catfish someone or have fake accounts bouncing around with your photos. Its become an addiction for people of all ages, yes, even your grandmother scrolls endlessly and mindlessly for hours at a time.

Thats fine and dandy though. People cause drama ?????it&#39;s happened ever since the days of Myspace but Facebook should hold itself accountable when it comes to users privacy.

"(?????????)This app used to be a great app for people to keep in touch with relatives or friends and let everyone know about their day or thoughts on personal matters... but no longer. Now its infested with politics, division, anger, and spam. Lots of spam accounts. You cant read the comments on a post without being inundated with spam comments trying to get you to buy some crap or go to some porn website. Reporting them does nothing. Facebook either cant figure out how to delete the profiles permanently or just doesnt care. I guess the big bosses at Facebook are too busy trying to silence republicans that they cant be bothered to deal with the mundane chore of cleaning up their website/ app.
Also after the many updates and new improvements to the app, it is no longer user friendly. What used to be a simple setup has become confusing and tiresome for the user. Chat messages are no longer accessible on the website or on the app. You have to have another app for it. The timeline is never in order and even if you click on see first on a friend, it may be days or even a week before you see their posts.  Fb used to have a calader with all your friends birthdays, or other special events on it and it would send you reminders a week or two in advance...and then on the birthday or anniversary day... not anymore.

First of all they are now rearranging comments taking them out of chronological order and making serious conversations look completely bizarre and hard to follow and so in a sense slandering those engaged in the conversation. Ive also had a couple videos censored. After reading the explanation for why they censored it there was an obviously bias perspective that did not address everything as a whole. They twisted what the video was saying with their perspective and not verbatim. Grown adults should be able to use their own discretion as to whether or not something is touching on the truth without having another stranger who obviously is going to have an opinion & bias of their own interject. Im also not very fond of how theyve grown so big that theyre taking it upon themselves to tap into personal conversations for marketing as well as how much they are involved in obtaining personal information other than what somebody blatantly gives them such as the about information the user fills out themselves.

"(?????????)I have ZERO interest in using an app/website that has not only blatantly interfered in our elections, but have spent the last four years (and likely longer) working to censor its users whos views oppose those of their CEO and employees. 

I believe when all is said and done, we will find that the extent in which Zuckerberg and Dorsey have meddled, infringed upon our freedoms, and actively worked to take down an entire political party and constituency, was MASSIVE. 

Conservatives have been painted out to be white trash hillbillies on their site simply for rejecting the idea of socialism. All with the spying, prying eyes of their fact checkers. 

The hysterical part is, most posts and articles theyve slapped some warning on have wound up being accurate.

"(?????????)As a social media outlet that is against free speech, I find if appalling and offensive that you go after one group of people (conservatives) but you will let the other group (democrats) get out of line and routinely go unchecked. People should be free to say what they think. The only time a post should he removed is if there is a direct threat to another person or if there is a post that suggests harm to another individual. Take notice there is a huge difference between showing a meme about a cop being slaughtered with a knife (yes FB allowed it) and posts talking about a historical event where people were murdered, such as the holocaust or Ottoman Empire. FB deploys so called Fact checkers who wouldnt know the facts if it hit them over the head. Those Fact checkers have the nerve to go into your private page!

"By now we should all be aware of whats really going on & the only way we will take back our autonomy online is to show these people that they need US and that we dont need THEM. One look at metas shares recently should show you that they are down by 26.39%all in one day. The censorship & blatant abuse of their power is too obvious now. They think they can control us until we all form a mass exodus from these apps & deleting them to go & live in REAL LIFE. I no longer use social media, that means no Facebook, no messenger, no instagram, no twitter, no Snapchat and last but not least the growing tumor that is TikTok. I know the youth arent aware enough to quit using social media because they directly target them as the audience to keep them enslaved in social media platforms all the while censoring us all from speaking the truth, too bad most of us are here in the comments & in real life waking people up regardless, as adults we are conscious enough to decide what kind of media we allow our brains to consume. Just like bad food is bad for your body, bad media is bad for your mind. The censorship and social media banning is out of control & most of it is because of artificial intelligence that they use to scan for violations of their terms of service. They aim to control every aspect of our lives & if we speak out they push a button & block you from all your apps & accounts. Then they also pretty much black list your names, emails, phone numbers, device information, etc. And this is only a fraction of what they track. Most of these apps have made you all agree to their new privacy policies and they all take effect November 3rd of this year. Coincidence? The time to act is now. Tell everyone you know. Delete your socials. Regain control of your lives, your minds, your spirits & your strength. They want to completely drain us of our energy & what better way than to constantly making us read divisive articles about race, religion & sexual orientation? All while they preach about safe spaces? Do you not see the contradictions? This is beyond politics & race now. Do the right thing. I give Facebook 1 star but Id give them -5 stars if the option was available. Ive never been happier & free from all the toxicity this app promotes since I chose to delete Facebook once & for all. If we all unite we may see a brighter day. My hope is people continue to wake up and wake up their friends and families. I mean who in the heck is mark zuckerbot anyways?

"Here we are years later and the same issues still persist with Facebook. It is hard to keep up with the updates. It seems as soon as I get one update installed there is another waiting the next day. It wouldnt be so bad but they cant be downloaded unless connected to a WiFi network, no cellular data can be used. I dont have an issue with storage because i purchased more iCloud storage years ago. But I can see this being a problem for many people especially if they use Facebook and messenger as they are large downloads. Hence the reason you have to be connected to a WiFi network to download. Not to mention, when these updates are pushed through every two weeks, most of the bugs arent being squashed. So what exactly are these updates for? Its becoming more of a pain than pleasure or fun networking. Seems like every time there is an update the last two months, the functionally gets worse and worse.

"(?????????)Facebook now INVADES your posts with unwanted so called fact checkers who are no more than Socialist/Communist shills. It is so agitating to post something and have it curtained with a semi-transparent, gray cover that directly discourages your friends from viewing your posts. This is Communist censorship and a clear violation of Constitution guaranteed free speech! Areas that receive immediate censorship or unwanted Facebook INTRUSION on your posts are: questioning COVID or vaccines, questioning the elections and electronic voting, health issues, conservative issues, etc. Also, you can easily be suspended for days, weeks or months for posts you may make that Facebook somehow thinks violates their community standards WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT SO CALLED COMMUNITY STANDARDS youre accused of violating! Facebook is a dangerous Ap that tracks you, listens to you and monitors you! It wants access to most all your phones resources such as photos, contacts, GPS, microphone (spying) etc. How spooky is it to have been talking about a product in the vicinity of your phone with this Ap, to later see Ads appear on your Facebook news feed for those types of products?!

I stay off those pages over the weekends (remember days off?) and when I went to check something on a whim, there were my posts I thought I was sending to my personal account.

Each update makes this platform more and more worthless.

I also got flagged for commenting on a friends post with an inside joke and you said I was inciting violence. When anything gets appealed, the button sends an auto denial back without any reviews happening. Now, if I try to share a post, it gives me a black screen saying the share went through then locks the screen so I have to close the app and reopen it.

"I opened my Facebook account in the early 2000s and instantly fell in love with the app. For 15 years I spent every day posting statuses and interacting with friends and family. I even started my own business with a Facebook page. Facebook was the best thing on my phone! UNTIL!!! I made an honest yet horrible mistake, on July 11th, 2022, I inadvertently gave a hacker access to my account. The hacker changed the original email address and phone number and took over my account. This is the same email and phone number on the account since I created it! The hacker then began to message my friends and family to extort money or hack their accounts as well. I sent every report and email available through facebooks ridiculous help center I even sent a photo of my ID to Facebook in an attempt to retrieve my account. Because Instagram and Facebook are connected I tried to send Instagram a video selfie with which I was told they could not match me to myself. For about a month I desperately tried to get back into my account. Hundreds of my friends reported the account to no avail. FACEBOOK HAS NO OUTLET FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!! There is no email address to email, no physical address to send snail mail, no telephone number.NOTHING!!!! The help center is no better than an automated telephone answering system and I was completely ruined by the loss of my original Facebook account. They had no issue taking my money to push ads out on my business page, yet hold no accountability when I lost access to the account that I was spending on. I still use facebook, on a new account, but I will NEVER EVER SPEND ANOTHER DIME ON FACEBOOK ADS.

"My daughter, who has been a dedicated FB follower, poster, guru, etc - Forever!!!  One day, recently, she wanted to make another post; when she realized that all of the work she has done to make her page everything over the years was ripped from her - thats right, her entire profile just disappeared!!

She contacted FB, who of course, said they would do research to investigate the travesty, but its been weeks since shes heard anything concerning this strange occurrence.  Since then, she hasnt mentioned anything else about it.

My concern now: what is it that the perpetrator(s) want with her Profile & if theres personal information that they can violate her privacy via the FB app itself??!  Its concerning due to how sophisticated the hackers are today & savvy at breaking into other accounts thats saved on users  phone I digress.

"(?????????)Fakebook has become a disgusting platform that is tearing apart the very fabric of the United States. The algorithms give a person only what they want to see, not any other possible views. They censor their own customers to propagate their own agenda and views, with the customers having no recourse. They de-platform and demonetize individuals for having a different view then their far left views. There are always two sides to a story yet fakebook allows you only to see one side, their far left wing agenda. The propaganda that comes from this platform is destroying our country and it needs to stop!  Last but not least the COVID biological agents are killing people, Facebook should be held liable for the deaths because of their overreach and control of this subject alone. Not allowing Drs and scientist to present that data to the public, in what is considered the public square, has cost countless lives. Its called informed consent, new data is always available in Medicine, nothing is ever set in stone, it is always evolving.

Got my personal and my conservative page banned for sharing information on vaccines companies. Nothing related to Covid. Appealed and of course, UPHELD.

Facebook now determines WHAT information people using its platform see.it doesnt even have to be against community standards for them to restrict peoples ability to see posts. If it isnt the Facebook way, its no way. Just like they do in Communist China.

"Facebook itself became and example of how fascism operates in western democracies. Collusion between government and private companies. Censorship of any dissent.

Disgusting business model. Its not like Facebook has a moral code. We know how they sell our info to the highest bidder. We know how privacy is compromised. So the moto on Facebook is : we will control your speech. We will censor you for any arbitrary reason. We will sell your info and you cant do anything about it.

"Over the last 4 years those in power and in control of face book have shown they arent capable of managing their new found power. They have absolute power over this social media platform and whatever we the public want to post. No matter what political party you claim to be apart of, what religion, here in this country we have the right to express unpopular ideas. Any ideas. We are allowed to question the narrative. Whenever one group, left or right think they have all power, all wisdom, and can dictate to everyone else what to think and to say, their ends up being oppression, then violence. 
Face book now seems to want to control the narrative, suppress information, target certain groups and people with censorship or just wiping them out completely by kicking them of this and any other platforms they seem to have influence over. 
It makes me sick. 
I dont care who the president is, if you let anarchist criminals bent on destruction, violence, (these are white youth burning down businesses owned by immigrants) while wearing black hoods, then live stream it on face book, promoting their violence and truly destructive ideology, face book seems to have no problem with that, but when it comes to elections, picking our own leaders, they seem to think they know whats best for all of us, what we can see, what ideas we can read or speakers we can here.
Facebook isnt God, although they seem to think they are the arbiters of truth, they are doing exactly what their founder under oath said they were not. Talk about election interference. Facebook should be held accountable. 
Facebook was the pawn of Russia during the last election, now this election, their suppression of information was so out in the open, it makes me sick. 
So I wont have Facebook on my way much longer. 
30 year old tech tyrants that aim to control what I can read, suppress information I need to make important decisions, control the minds of our kids, and silence anyone they deem dangerous for any reason, thats the start of communist like control. 
I will vote with my dollars. Face book was great, now its dangerous and corrupt. Dont tell me how to live or what to think, Ill make my mind up on my own. 
I , like everyone , else thought Facebook was a wonderful thing, come to find out it could be the downfall of the freedoms we hold so incredibly dear.
They arent to be to fail. My privacy, my information, my beliefs and the way I think,

"(?????????)The year is 2021 and one of the largest social media platforms in the world refuses to provide its users with a News Feed presented in chronological order. 

The whole point of social media is to stay connected with friends and family.

Not to mention discovering news for the first time that was posted a week ago JUST NOW appearing on my feed.

Go ahead and refresh your feed multiple times over a few seconds while youre at it. Theres a very good chance it will rearrange  itself almost every time. 

Its obvious Facebook has a motive to leave News Feed the way it is. There have been settings in the past that would allow you to switch to most recent, but these options have all but moved to different dimensions, unable to be found, or disappeared entirely.

Seriously the worst part about this app is basically anything to do with your account. If you try to make one its complicated and  deleting one is even more difficult. When I tapped message in someones account it took me to messenger but it didnt open the inbox. Also the UI is pretty old and backdated compared to some of the other apps nowadays.

"I had this app for about 2 years. When I initially attempted to open the app, I found that someone was already using my information. I reported the problem to Instagram, changed the password and began to use the app. For personal reasons, after deciding to delete my account, I immediately found out that its close to impossible to do so. You cannot delete it from the app itself. You have to go through a totally different website to complete deletion. In an attempt to do that, the website continued to reroute me back to the app itself In attempting to retrieve my password (which I forgot), it sent me a verification code that did not work Several times!!   In a final attempt to delete this app, I tried to remove all of my pictures and personal information. And Instagram blocked me after deleting half of my information So I deleted the app from my iPhone so that I could download the app and attempt to recover my password in order to permanently delete this app. After going back into the App Store to download Instagram, it required me to verify my Apple ID. After doing so, I still cant download this app!! I do not want my information just out there in cyber space floating around!! I need this app permanently deleted ASAP!!!

"I love Facebook for a lot of reasons, but I thoroughly hate that there is no customer service available when it is desperately needed. 

Someone from another country hacked my account, posted explicit material to get me locked out and deleted forever, added himself to my business suite, and then began trying to scam people into calling his cell phone to purchase speakers to scam them.

 I wouldnt have known any of this had I not had a Shopify chat plugin installed on my website.

 I was locked out of my FB account and messenger, but all of these messages in Vietnamese were coming through to my phone via the Shopify chat plugin. 

I used Google translate to warn these people in their language (Vietnamese) that I was hacked and this man was trying to scam them. 

Shopify customer service is wonderful, but unfortunately theres nothing they can do about my FB account.

 It says it will be permanently deleted in 25 days if they havent reviewed by then, and they might not ever review due to being short staffed with Covid-19. 

There is NO WAY for me to explain to Facebook what happened, NO WAY for me to email them

 Did you know I cant even report that Ive been hacked unless Im signed into my Facebook account? 

AND if I try to sign in Im blocked from accessing any page except the one that says I violated community standards and my account will be permanently deleted in 25 days.

What is with you? This website is annoying, nothing more. I will never give Facebook money. You get enough money from ad revenue and now you harass and rob small businesses?

Keep it up, though. Many younger people I know are ditching Facebook (which is why Zuckerburg is making a sad, desperate attempt to stay relevant by buying out his competition). Were tired of Facebook siding with racists, tired of Facebooks blatant transphobia, and tired of all the nasty people it has attracted. Family members who sit there spying and talking crap and posting trash.

Facebook allows scammers to create fake profiles to solicit others and will not remove them. Facebook has caused major problems with society - where people say nasty things to others and spread lies and toxicity. 

Using this app is a complete invasion of privacy and they spy on everything you do and say. How is this legal? 

Also, Im an admin for a page and when I post multiple photos, they do not show up correctly. One photo will show in the feed without the text and other photos.

"The ecosystem of the network is based on profiting from viral content, which, in particular, contains features of conspiracy theory, misogyny and racism and, as a result, causes pronounced negative emotions.  The network's algorithms, designed with the goal of ""maximizing user engagement"" on apps, amplify and promote such content.

  Because people are more likely to ""click"" on sensational and outrageous content, social media's ""recommendation systems"" can edit the user down a ""rabbit hole"" of toxic accumulation.
In addition, in many countries FB is the only way to draw attention to important social problems and solve them.  In totalitarian countries, the network is often almost the only tool to talk about human rights violations, to be heard and to call for help from the international community.

At the same time, when you try to post content that informs about the cruelty of the totalitarian regime, your materials are thoughtlessly, without proper evaluation, are deleted.

Content evaluation for compliance with community standards is carried out absolutely thoughtlessly by machines, when you try to appeal, they ignore you.
    
     The main problem is that Facebook occupies an extremely important place in people's lives.  At the same time, users themselves do not have the tools to influence the social network and control mechanisms for how their personal data is used and what algorithms form our information space.

There was absolutely nothing wrong with my ad, it was for a car detailing company and after requesting FB to review my account over a WEEK ago I still have no clue why my account was even restricted! When you press see details it just takes you to a generic page that talks about how they use an automated review. Ads are subject to our ad review system, which relies primarily on automated review to check ads against our Advertising Policies It would be great if they at least told me what I did wrong, and not just restricted my business account without any sort of explanation!!

"(?????????)Facebook makes me feel as if I'm being used for advertising.

Sadly, I don't trust Facebook Marketplace anymore due to it's over advertising. It has become monotonous to adjust the search criteria to local only every time I want to use the feature. Scammers and advertisements for non-local products appear, making the experience somewhat disappointing.

The notifications have been getting weirder and weirder.

Back in the day, Facebook sent out notifications if a friend tagged you in a post, commented on one of your pictures, or liked something you shared/Posted. Nowadays, you get all notifications from strangers commenting in a group you both follow. 

Non-priority notifications feel very disingenuous. 

I tried switching my notifications to priority and was glitched out of getting any notifications for weeks. I would get on Facebook and see that someone tagged me in something, but I would have no notifications at all. I was finally able to switch back to All Notifications but now I'm back to notification spam desperately trying to make me stay in Facebook longer.

"Worst Facebook experience yet. Remember when forums and chat applications werent glamorous nor sold your data, but they worked? Disgruntled software engineers who are early adopters remember. We traded anonymity and function for form and boring dystopia and somehow there is thunderous applause? 

CAPTCA doesnt initialize properly and youll be stuck in an infinite loop of suspicious activity that might require another computer thats already authorized, a web browser with dev tools open, or even a Google voice number to use temporarily 

Mobile authorization codes arent sent to SMS or email. 

Typo literally anything in your login or signup, expect to never sign in on your device without a secondary device to correct the error state, such as captcha or verifying your email and/or phone number. Literally deadweight and for someone who only uses it to talk to people who only use messenger and not signal or discord, or even RCS (@ apple fanbois, literally no one cares, take your gentrification of technology elsewhere)Definitely makes me push alternatives and backups harder. One day well be free of this self-imposed nonsense and youve missed an opportunity to sell more data today, Zuck.

Ive never *not* had a problem with Facebook mobile app, though this iPhone version should probably be deprecated as you clearly dont support the device model or iOS version (latest available on device). For a mobile first company youre doing an awful job, you should be paying me for the data collection and terrible user experience - its virtually emotionally and mentally damaging.

"Facebook has been playing monopoly on a political agenda for years now, just because they dont like a different political view point than what they have, they will remove your posts, cripple your reach of viewers following your page, and they will give you temporary bans to the app, and eventually perma-ban you. If you are looking for freedom of speech to be able to speak your mind about your viewpoint on anything going on in the country, world or with any business or organization, Facebook is not the place you want to be. 

Then theres the topic of pages you make, they limit the amount of your followers who see your posts, and require you to pay money to boost each of your posts so that you can ensure all of your followers get to see it in their feed.

And then we also have the issue of Facebook stealing your data and selling it to other organizations for profit. Nothing you do or share on Facebook is private or protected.

"(?????????)Im getting very frustrated with Facebook and your pick and choose process. Ive had my account since 2009 and dont get to enjoy some of the features my friends enjoy. When you offer new features you should make sure they are available to all your members. I have an Avatar, but do not have any of the backgrounds. Ive tried to be patient, but even that is wearing thin. I also see Im not the only one with this issue (google search), but I am the only one as far as personal acquaintances. Please dont make me the last to enjoy this!

"Facebook needs a new business model, since the one it helped invent is now known as cyber-stalking. It&#39;s great that they helped the world realize this is a boundary, but they have yet to adapt to said realization. They intentionally do not allow you to update the photos they have access to from the app. If you cannot select which photos you want to share with them, you may be more inclined to share all of your photos out of convenience. Given their business is based on nonconsensual data harvesting, it&#39;s not a surprise to me.",4,facebook need new busi model sinc one help invent known cyberstalk it39 great help world realiz boundari yet adapt said realiz intent allow updat photo access app can not select photo want share may inclin share photo conveni given busi base nonconsensu data harvest it39 surpris

FB engages in medical discrimination! Dont you dare ask or answer questions about risks associated with vaccinesOr any other natural approach to health. I can quote information straight from the CDC and their fact checkers will shut you down or publicly accuse you of deception or lying. Personal stories of vaccine injury are definitely not permitted either. The injured are silenced. Denied a voice to tell their story or find others with similar stories to lean on. Medical discrimination. There is no freedom of speech on this platform. Its become an over regulated and corporately imposed echo chamber.,4,fb engag medic discrimin dont dare ask answer question risk associ vaccinesor natur approach health quot inform straight cdc fact checker shut publicli accus decept lie person stori vaccin injuri definit permit either injur silenc deni voic tell stori find other similar stori lean medic discrimin freedom speech platform becom regul corpor impos echo chamber

"As a middle-aged single woman/parent. I was fortunate to have the opportunity to raise my only child; completely off of social media. 
I am not completing shutting down Social Media. I am just concerned with the information an individual; who may be an acquaintance, friend and/or foe, family or in the professional field. What they are able to observe, collect, manipulate and misinterpret; to their own self-needs &amp; pleasures. 
All it takes is one individual to allow another individual to view their page. That is all it takes for someones personal, private life. To be complicated. 
I grew up in a world that Sharing was Caring. I still believe in this; in my personal, private life and life style. 
Sharing to gain power? At whos cost? Someones entire life? All for a free look I to ones personal life? Disturbing and challenged behaviors should be banned from Facebook. Just as other individuals who lose their rights to bare weapons; or even live a normal life within general population.

"I am currently in South Korea and As of July 26, today, the app is not letting me scroll on Facebook or even post. Its not letting message on messenger, or even open it for that matter, before I get a message on my screen that says it is mandatory that I share my personal information including my location in order to use Facebook/messenger. When I choose to exit out of the message it says I have to agree to the terms or deactivate or delete my entire Facebook page. My concern and question is why do I have to give up my personal information, just to use a social media app? Why is it not my decision on whether or not I want to share it? Why is it being made mandatory to give up MY information JUST to use Facebook? This isnt making any sense. And I have asked my family back in the states if they have the same issue and they are all saying no, its not happening there. So that bring me to my next question, is it only happening here? And if so, WHY? We already post pictures and statuses on Facebook, our name is up there, why do you want us to go IN DEPTH with OUR personal information just to use Facebook?

"(?????????)Beware that the Marketplace is stealing your money on a regular basis. I decided to try selling through FB Marketplace. At first it was good, but now its crazy! They updated things frequently, and its not working properly anymore. Now they have a new practice: they started stealing your payouts! First time it happened to me, I sold a dress. My payout was $45, but they sent me only $8. I asked for help, but they ignored me. Adam said he saw that they sent me $45, and I have to ask my bank. I sent him all the proof that they sent only $8. Keep in mind, its easy to check this information from their side. The bank just deposits the amount which was sent. I asked Adam to provide me transaction details such as a transaction number to proof that they sent me $45, and Adam just didnt respond. They know that I am right, but do nothing to help. No support or anything. 
The second time I sold a book. Guess what? My payout is just simply gone from my payout page! Vanished! I never got it! Nobody cares! They always claim that they sent you your payouts and that you should ask your bank. But the bank deposits the amounts that YOU SEND! 
You are not protected!
Very unprofessional workers!
Just think about it: a billion dollar company is stealing your poor amount of earnings. Before you launch a marketplace for people to use you have to test it first and then release it to the public.

"Facebook is not social media now. It is Socialist Media to suppress, censor, control and manipulate to help interfere to cheat to steal Elections and control Citizens 

Facebook should be sued in Class Action Lawsuits and forced to pay Billions in Settlements to make their stock truly Penny Stock for Privacy Violations, Forced Politics and Domestic Terror Group BLM, Biased News 1 sided Censorship, allowing Bullying and Harassment and Mocking Personal Appearance of any one including mocking the President of the United States and his Family 

Facebook helps spread and fuel Hate 

Facebook warns and restricts many who stand up to Bullies and those who harass but Facebook  allows the name calling, bullying and harassment 

Facebook allows and helps Child sex trafficking and child porn  

Think of that the next time you see Missing Poster with someone looking for their Child 

Think of that the next time you see Child commit Suicide due to online Bullying 

Think of that the next time you see School Shooting or Mass Shooting where some one Snaps to Lash out to kill others due to the Hate and Bullying 

FB is a festering blemish on our Society and Life 

Facebook manipulates and controls 

Mark is right when he said people are dumb Zucks to trust him and Facebook 

Hopefully one day he will get it when it affects someone he loves 

Facebook helped Divide the United States 

Facebook allows Libel, slander, defamation of character, disrespect and hate for Americans and American President, American Flag and Our Constitution 

Facebook controls and manipulated to suppress to Interfere with 2020 Election of President and other State and Local Elections. 

Facebook should be held accountable and forced to pay

"To begin, I believe there has been a little improvement in the fact checking sector. With that said.. how did you let it get this far? Money and advertising? Ive reported obvious hate speech from Donald Trump and you let it fly. Sure freedom of speech is the First Amendment but when it incorporates lies, hate speech, and division then we need to stand up and fight evil not silently let it thrive. As for reports I have made about fake accounts, who is checking those at 3am and making a decision that they are valid within 15 minutes? Thats not validation and if its that early in the morning then either the people doing it are in another country or you dont care. Mark, is it because the world was terrible to you or did things just get tough man? I know the world is a cold place so we must fight to make it better. I dont blame any person, group of people, or specific organization but rather evil and Satan that looks to destroy. I was always taught to hate the sin not the sinner.

There are so many accounts on Facebook that dont have any picture of the persons face and thats literally the name of the company. Accounts full of memes, videos, hate, and a bunch of crap with a name. Im sure this is no easy task for Facebook but integrity, core values, and the unity of our country is at stake. Facebook and Twitter are used for chaos now when they use to be decent platforms. Connecting people and socializing with those from a far is the point of these. Share some laughs and love. But it has turned to targeting ads as a way of manipulating people, their actions, and playing God. Get back to the fundamentals and maybe Ill use this again, the best part is sharing joy with family and friends. As for now I wont use Facebook for a while.",4,begin believ littl improv fact check sector said let get far money advertis ive report obviou hate speech donald trump let fli sure freedom speech first amend incorpor lie hate speech divis need stand fight evil silent let thrive report made fake account check 3am make decis valid within 15 minut that valid earli morn either peopl anoth countri dont care mark world terribl thing get tough man know world cold place must fight make better dont blame person group peopl specif organ rather evil satan look destroy alway taught hate sin sinner mani account facebook dont pictur person face that liter name compani account full meme video hate bunch crap name im sure easi task facebook integr core valu uniti countri stake facebook twitter use chao use decent platform connect peopl social far point share laugh love turn target ad way manipul peopl action play god get back fundament mayb ill use best part share joy famili friend wont use facebook
